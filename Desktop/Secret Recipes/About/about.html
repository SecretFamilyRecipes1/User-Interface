            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>
                Secret Family Recipes was overseen and built over the course of a week by students of varying backgrounds and skillsets at Lambda School. Our site is the culmination of the different units taught at Lambda School. Teamwork and communication helped us to launch this site and make it a fully functional and convenient tool. The creative skills of our user-interface, front-end, and back-end developers, with the coordination of our Project Lead helped to deliver this product. We hope you enjoy this site and its many useful tools and features.
